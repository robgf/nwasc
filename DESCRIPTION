Description: The nwasc package was written by FWS for BOEM to
    segment transect survey data from the Northwest Atlantic Seabird
    Catalog (maintained by FWS).  Each transect is segmented into fixed
    length segments with the remainder placed according to a set rule.
    Observations are tallied by segment and transect.
